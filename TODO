Features:
 - Unit movement (with semitransparent overlay)
   o Just <x> squares for now, no tile-walkability
   - Add "facing" direction
   - Once we have tiles, implement a smarter "distance" algorithm
 - Make tiles more than just images (ie can have attributes, etc)
 - Implement menu
 - Make "border" around cursor so it can't be directly on the edge.

Bugs/cleanup/maintenance:
 - Make "view" more consistent. 
   - (May need to modify draw commands to take a rectangle, eg drawTile(a, b)(ctx, x, y, w, h) although that's probably premature optimisation)
 - Key Handler may be dropping keypresses (event listener vs tick())
 - Remove global 32x32 (tile size) constants, and global 5x5 (view size) constants

Edward:
 - Design me some pretty menu-style please? (colors, fonts, borders, "current" icon/highlight)

DONE:
 o Host it somewhere so Ed can commit
 o Add units
 o Add menu/text stack. Trigger menu by pressing A on empty terrain for now.
